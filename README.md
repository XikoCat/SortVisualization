# SortVisualization
A visualization of some sorting algorithms in Processing

This Processing sketch was a 1 afternoon project and "challenge" to myself.

This sketch gives a visual and audio demonstration of how some sorting algorithms work.
It comes with 3 sorting algorithms:
 - Bubble Sort
 - Insertion Sort
 - Selection Sort

To change between the different sorting algorithms change the function it is calling inside draw() by commenting th unused functions and uncommenting the function you want to use.
Default is insertionSort():
```
    //selectionSort();
    //bubbleSort();
    insertionSort();
```
